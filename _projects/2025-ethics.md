In order to gain a full scope of engineering ethics and dilemmas, the example of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. When looking at this issue, 5 main ideas or questions were evaluated, based on the fundamentals of engineering ethics and company considerations.

The Boeing 737 Max aircraft was a plane model that had serious MCAS software issues that caused two fatal crashes. This software change was made as a means of Boeing trying to compete with Airbus to make a more advanced plane model. The change in the new plane model was not communicated with Boeing pilots, or with the public.

This raised 5 scenarios/questions demonstrating where Boeing could have acted differently:



1. ***Why did the plane designers modify designs and implement MCAS without requiring additional pilot training?***

Stakeholders: Pilots, Engineers, Boeing regulators.

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5 and #2. Because of hierarchical and economic pressures, along with company culture, the Pilots were not trained as this would take extra time to roll out the new plane.

Ethics Solution: Safety is the number one thing that engineers should be concerned with when making a design. The FAA should make a regulation that makes it so pilots must be trained. Then the company decisions would not be internal, eliminating company pressure.

2. ***Why was there a lack of transparency with pilots about MCAS?***

Stakeholders: Pilots, Airports, Boeing, Passengers

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5, #3, #7 and #2. Boeing did not want the Pilots to know about the technology, as they didn’t really want anyone to know about it.

Ethics Solution: The FAA should make regulations so that any time there is a change on the plane, they are notified of what it is and how it works.

3. ***Why did Boeing not immediately ground all remaining flights after the first plane crash?***

Stakeholders: Pilots, Boeing, Airports, Passengers, Engineers

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5, #7 and #2. Because of image pressures and Boeing trying to remain competitive, the company did not ground flights.

Ethics Solution: Boeing should have grounded all planes immediately and ran a full engineering review, as Canon #1 takes all precedence.

4. ***Why were Boeing Engineers shut down when asking questions about the way MCAS were implemented?***

Stakeholders: Engineers, Boeing shareholders

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5, #4 and #2. Boeing leaders wanted to be able to push forward with designs, no matter what.

Ethics Solution: The engineers should not be pressured to sign off on technologies unless they feel confident about it. There should be multiple design review and considerations.

5. ***Did Boeing adequately Balance profit with human factors?***

Stakeholders: Pilots, Passengers, Boeing, Engineers

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5, #4 and #6. Boeing was concerned with making a profit.

Ethics solution: Engineers should always make sure that safety is a top priority.
