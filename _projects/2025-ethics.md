Inorder to gain a full scope of engineering ethics and dilemmas, the example of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. When looking at this issue, 5 main ideas or questions where evaluated, based on the fundamentals of engineering ethics and company considerations.


The Boeing 737 Max aircraft was a plane model that had serious MCAS software issues that caused two fatal crashes. This software change was made as a means of Boeing trying to compete with Airbus to make a more advanced plane model. The change in the new plane model was not communicated with Boeing pilots, or with the public. 

This rasied 5 senarios/questions demonstrating where Boeing could have acted differently: 

The canon engineering ethics are: 


1. ***Why did the plane designers modify designs and impliment MCAS without requiring additional poilot training?***

Stake holders; Pilots, Engineers, Boeing regulators.

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5 and #2. Because of heirrachal and economic pressures, along with company culture, the Pilots where not trained as this would take extra time to role out the new plane.

Ethics Solution: Saftey is the number one thing that engineers should be concerned with when making a design. The FAA should make a regulation that makes it so pilots must be trained. Then the company descions would not be internal, eliminating company pressure. 

2. ***Why was there a lack of transparency with pilots about MCAS?***

Stake holders: Pilots, Airports, Boeing, Passengers

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5, #3, #7 and #2. Boeing did not want the Pilots to know about the technology, as they didnt really want anyone to know about it. 

Ethics Solution: The FAA should make regulations so that any time there is a chnage on the plane, they are notifed of what it is and how it works. 


3. ***Why did Boeing not immediatly ground all remaining flights after the first plane crash?***

Stake Holders: Pilots, Boeing, Airports, Passengers, Engineers

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5, #7 and #2. Because of image pressures and Boeing trying to remain competive, the company did not ground flights. 

Ethics Solution: Boeing should have grounded all planes immediatly and ran a full engineering review, as Canon #1 takes all precedence. 

4. ***Why where Boeing Engineers shut down when asking questions about the way MCAS where implimented?***

Stake Holders: Engineers, Boeing shareholders

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5, #4 and #2. Boeing leaders wanted to be able to push forward with designs, no matter what. 

Ethics Solution: The engineers should not be pressured to sign off on technologies unless they feel confident about it. There should be multiple design review and considerations. 

5. ***Did Boeing adequetly Balance profit with human factors?***

Stakeholders: Pilots, Passengers, Boeing, Engineers

This issue deals with the engineering canons #1, #5, #4 and #6. Boeing was concered with making a profit. 

Ethics solution: Engineers should always make sure that saftey is a top proritey.
